    <string name="cais_de_gaia_address"> Cais de Gaia, 4400&#8211;161</string>
    <string name="desc_cais_de_gaia">The views from Cais de Gaia are perhaps the longest-lasting images of Oporto for visitors. It\'s impossible not to stand in awe at the city\'s stunning skyline, whose impact is further enhanced by the picturesque boats that stand in front, and the soaring double-decker Dom Luis Bridge. Breathe in the atmosphere from the several cafes and restaurants at the riverfront (Bogani Café is especially recommended for a drink and chill-out sounds), and then visit the terracotta-topped Port Wine warehouses that stand behind them.</string>

    <string name="serralves_museum_address">R. Dom João de Castro 210, 4150&#8211;417 Porto</string>
    <string name="desc_serralves_museum">This world&#8211;class museum displays cutting-edge international contemporary art in a striking minimalist building by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Alvaro Siza Vieira. Like the Guggenheim, there is no collection permanently on display, with temporary exhibitions taking up the entire space.The eighteen hectares of grounds also contain natural farmland, and are dotted with modern sculptures.</string>
    //Casa da Música
    <string name="attraction_casa_da_musica">Casa da Música</string>
    <string name="casa_da_musica_address">Av. da Boavista 604&#8211;610, 4149&#8211;071 Porto</string>
    <string name="desc_casa_da_musica">This twelve-storey, irregular-shaped building was designed by world-renowned architect Rem Koolhaas exclusively for musical performances. It opened in 2005 and for admirers of architectural marvels it justifies a visit to Oporto on its own. The striking white concrete structure is an inventive building. Inside the 1,300-seat auditorium of perfect acoustics is a baroque organ pinned to the wall, and the VIP room has hand-painted blue tiles, blending contemporary minimalism with traditional touches. </string>
